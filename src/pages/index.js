          Hello ðŸ‘‹
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm Brent, a principal software engineer with a career-long focus on UIs and
          APIs. I specialize in the manufacturing and distribution industries and really enjoy the blend of physical and digital tech that comes along with this space.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>Something important to know about me is that I prefer and focus on smaller companies reanging from pre-seed startups to a few thousand employees.  I've never worked for a major tech company so I don't focus on problems companies of that size encounter. </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Enough about me though, check out my blog below.  It's always hand-crafted with no AI.</p>
        <br />
        <br />
